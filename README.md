# Hello-World
My first repository, albeit a simple one (mostly to test waters).

Essentially, 

1. Create a repository on GitHub (do not initialize with a README quite yet.)
2. Open Terminal and navigate to the working directory of the project you
   would like to add.
3. Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.

   `git init`

4. Add the files in the local repository - this gets the ready for the first
   commit.

   `git add .`

5. Commit the files that you've staged. This commits the tracked changes and
   prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository.

   `git commit -m "YOUR COMMENT HERE"`

6. At your GitHub repository's page, copy the remote repository URL.
7. In Terminal, add the URL for the remote repository where the local
   repository will be pushed.

   `git remote add origin REMOTE REPOSITORY URL`

8. Push the changes in the local repository to GitHub.

   `git push origin master`
